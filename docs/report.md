## Building compentents in the browser

I have been buildig Components in the browser using SASS to make my code more maintainable. I had to do some reading on how to set up a SASS project, but i got the syntax pretty quickly. I have mostly been using it for the use of variables.

### Liberary

I have been testing the following Liberary for production.

* [https://leafletjs.com/] - Leaflet JS is Open Source Map for the about page.
* [https://p5js.org/] - For data vizualization.

### API
I have also been setting up for use of APIs
* [https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API]
* [https://openweathermap.org] 

# Conclusion

I am a little bit behind on shcedule but i do not think it will be a problem. I was supposed to be finished with the HTML5 prototype, and see now that still have some more work to do. I will be cutting down a little on looks, and make sure the webiste is accesible and the content is good. Then next week i will be continuing with the JavaScript development. Integrating features to the site.
